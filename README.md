This is the final project for the iOS group based class - team 2.

###Branches and their contents:

##Master Branch

This branch contains an abandoned precursor project (firebaseAuthTest), a sample project to help with data requests (HalfTunes), and the sql file to build the necessary backend database for our project.

##AppBuildWithoutPhotos

This branch contains our finalized project with all the functionality we had time to implement

##FinalAppDesign

This branch contains our project without the photos component, but with an updated UI we were experimenting with

##web-api

This branch contains the backend server script we had planned to implement as part of our app. While we didn't have time to implement this component, the pieces are all here for a complete server interface which returns JSON depending on JSON values it is sent. Additionally, this branch contains a test project that shows that media upload and download work and an intermediary stage of the final design product.

##photo-example

This branch really just contains another, incomplete, copy of the media upload and download test project.

##Photo-import

This branch contains a sample function to show how to call and use an imagePicker.
